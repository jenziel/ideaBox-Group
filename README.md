### Abstract:
- This user-friendly web app allows users to record and archive their ideas. After giving their idea a name and description in the title and body input fields respectively, users can save their idea and it will appear on a card. Idea cards can be favorited or deleted. Adding to the functionality of this application, users can filter only their favorited ideas by clicking the button “Show Starred Ideas.”  The features included are:
- The ability to save a new idea each time the page loads
- The ability to delete any previously saved ideas
- The ability to favorite idea cards when a user clicks the star button
- The ability to filter only the favorited ideas

### Installation Instructions:
- Git clone this repo to your local machine
- Cd into that directory
- Enter the command open index.html to open the browser
- Have fun recording your ideas!

### Learning Goals:
- Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
- Ensure that all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Build out functionality using functions that follow SRP
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded: adding, removing, and updating elements, first in the Data Model and then on the DOM
- Deepen our understanding of the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Write code collaboratively
- Practice reading and understanding code written by other team members
- Document changes with atomic commits and code reviews during standups

### Wins + Challenges:
### Wins: 
- We each brought different strengths to the project, which gave each of us an opportunity to reinforce our knowledge and learn new techniques. 
- In addition to researching when we were stuck, we revisited the Data Model lesson to better understand the concept.
We became better at troubleshooting by using console.log in Dev Tools. 
- We improved at working asynchronously as a group. We established a successful workflow between different levels of experience, schedules, and timezones. 
### Challenges:
- After taking the initial steps of building out HTML structure and styling the page to match the comp as a group of four, we decided it would be easier to tackle subsequent features in pairs of two. This arrangement was a positive solution to having too many cooks in the kitchen.
- Even though we had a morning standup to review code that was written without everyone present before merging it, it was sometimes hard to understand code we hadn’t written ourselves and how it might connect to new code.
